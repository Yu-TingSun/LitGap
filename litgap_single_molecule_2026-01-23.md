## 📘 About This Report

### What are "knowledge gaps"?

Papers frequently cited by your library but not in your collection. 
These represent important works you may have overlooked.

### How is scoring calculated?

- **Mention frequency**: How many of your papers cite it (highest weight)
- **Academic impact**: Total citation count
- **Recency**: Publication year (recent papers get bonus)

### About 📚 "Early influential work"

Papers marked with 📚 are among the **earliest in your recommendations** 
with significant citations. This label is based on **relative analysis** 
within your library, not absolute field history.

**Important**: We identify papers that appear important in YOUR research 
context, but cannot guarantee they are definitively "pioneering" works 
in the broader field.

### Reading suggestions

1. Start with **Priority Reading** (Top 3 + Early influential)
2. Click on DOI links to access papers directly (works with Zotero extensions)
3. Use Semantic Scholar for additional context and related papers
4. Focus on papers with highest mention counts (cited by multiple papers)
